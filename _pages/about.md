I am now a fourth year Ph.D. student studying in the [Department of Computing](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) , under the supervision of [Dr. Xiapu Luo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/). I also work closely with [Dr. Yajin Zhou](http://yajin.org/). 

Before coming to PolyU, I received my B.Eng. in [Department of Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/),  [Tongji University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2016.

My current research interests include network security, system security and IoT security. More specifically, I am interested in reverse engineering, binary analysis, firmware rehosting, fuzzing techniques and DDoS.
